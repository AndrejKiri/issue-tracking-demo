Grafana Play already has a TON of data, content, and apps configured already, so it is a good place to start. 

Once you get set up in Grafana Cloud, ask your tech buddy and / or your UX colleagues to add you to an org that has some integrations and plugins configured so you can see those dashboards. 

Grafana University is our customer facing training content - review it as you have questions!
